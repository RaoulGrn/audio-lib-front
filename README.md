# Audio Library

This project was made for the technical assessment of MMCTech. My task was to design and implement a digital music library, where youâ€™ll be able to visualize your artists and their albums and open the albums to view a description and list of songs.
You will also implement an autocomplete component that provides suggestions as a user enters a search box.  

Features:
