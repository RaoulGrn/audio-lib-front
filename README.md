# Audio Library - Frontend

This project was made for the technical assessment of MMCTech. My task was to design and implement a digital music library, where youâ€™ll be able to visualize your artists and their albums with a description and their songs.
I also had to implement an autocomplete component that provides suggestions as a user enters a search box. 

## Technologies Involved

* Backend in NestJs https://github.com/RaoulGrn/audio-lib-back/tree/master
* Frontend in React(vite).
  
### Other modules/plugins/technologies:
            * styled components
            * react-bootstrap
            * mdb-react-ui-kit
            * react-icons
            * tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer
            * lodash.debounce - for limiting unnecessary API calls (autocomplete feature)
            * react-toaster - for custom success/error messages (toasts)
  
## How to run

* Clone the project
  
```bash
$ npm install
```

* You should create .env file (yes, it works on frontend) and enter a Google Youtube Data v3 API BUT (for testing purposes I will let my .env file come with my API key for a few days, just for testing purposes. (It is restricted anyway so no harm can be done). Check photos if you want to replace it.

### Home Page - Where users can use the input to search for their preffered artists/album/songs.
* The input has an autocomplete feature that is sanitized and also has lodash.debounce implemented to limit unnecessary requests to the server
* If users click on a song title a youtube Iframe will appear and the browser will automatically focus on it
