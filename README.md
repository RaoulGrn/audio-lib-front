# Audio Library

This project was made for the technical assessment of MMCTech. My task was to design and implement a digital music library, where youâ€™ll be able to visualize your artists and their albums and open the albums to view a description and list of songs.
I also had to implement an autocomplete component that provides suggestions as a user enters a search box. 

## Technologies Involved

* Backend in NestJs
* Frontend in React(vite).
  
### Other modules/plugins/technologies:
            * styled components
            * react-bootstrap
            * mdb-react-ui-kit
            * react-icons
            * tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer
            * lodash.debounce - for limiting unnecessary API calls (autocomplete feature)
            * react-toaster - for custom success/error messages (toasts)
  
## How to run

* Clone the project
  
```bash
$ npm install
```

* You should create .env file (yes, it works on frontend) and enter a Google Youtube Data v3 API BUT (for testing purposes I will let my .env file come with my API key for a few days, just for testing purposes. (It is restricted anyway so no harm can be done). Check photos if you want to replace it.
